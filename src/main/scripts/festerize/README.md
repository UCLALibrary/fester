# Festerize

Uploads CSV files to the Fester IIIF manifest service for processing.

Any rows with an `Object Type` of `Collection` (i.e., "collection row") found in the CSV are used to create a IIIF collection.

Any rows with an `Object Type` of `Work` (i.e., "work row") are used to expand or revise a previously created IIIF collection (corresponding to the collection that the work is a part of), as well as create a IIIF manifest corresponding to the work. A "work" is conceived of as a discrete object (e.g., a book or a photograph) that one would access as an individual item.

Any rows with an `Object Type` of `Page` (i.e., "page row") are likewise used to expand or revise a previously created IIIF manifest (corresponding to the work that the page is a part of).

After Fester creates or updates any IIIF collections or manifests, it updates and returns the CSV files to the user.

The returned CSVs are updated to contain URLs (in a `IIIF Manifest URL` column) of the IIIF collections and manifests that correspond to any collection or work rows found in the CSV.

Note that the order of operations is important. The following will result in an error:

1. Running `festerize` with a CSV containing works that are part of a collection for which no IIIF collection has been created (i.e., the work's corresponding collection hasn't been festerized yet)

    - **Solution**: add a collection row to the CSV and re-run `festerize` with it, or run `festerize` with another CSV that contains the collection row

1. Running `festerize` with a CSV containing pages that are part of a work for which no IIIF manifest has been created (i.e., the page's corresponding work hasn't been festerized yet)

    - **Solution**: add a work row to the CSV and re-run `festerize` with it, or run `festerize` with another CSV that contains the work row

## Installation

First, ensure that you have Bash, cURL, Python 3 and Pip installed on your system.

When that's done, run the following command in your shell to install the latest release of Festerize:

    bash <(curl -sSL \
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCLALibrary/fester/master/src/main/scripts/festerize/install.sh)

## Usage

After it's installed, you can see the available options by running:

    festerize --help

When you do this, you should see the following:

  Uploads CSV files to the Fester IIIF manifest service for processing.

  Any rows with an `Object Type` of `Collection` (i.e., "collection row")
  found in the CSV are used to create a IIIF collection.

  Any rows with an `Object Type` of `Work` (i.e., "work row") are used to
  expand or revise a previously created IIIF collection (corresponding to
  the collection that the work is a part of), as well as create a IIIF
  manifest corresponding to the work. A "work" is conceived of as a discrete
  object (e.g., a book or a photograph) that one would access as an
  individual item.

  Any rows with an `Object Type` of `Page` (i.e., "page row") are likewise

  to the work that the page is a part of).

  After Fester creates or updates any IIIF collections or manifests, it

      1. Running `festerize` with a CSV containing works that are part of a
      collection for which no IIIF collection has been created (i.e., the

          - Solution: add a collection row to the CSV and re-run `festerize`
          with it, or run `festerize` with another CSV that contains the
          collection row

      2. Running `festerize` with a CSV containing pages that are part of a
      work for which no IIIF manifest has been created (i.e., the page's
      corresponding work hasn't been festerized yet)

          it, or run `festerize` with another CSV that contains the work row

  Arguments:

      SRC is either a path to a CSV file or a Unix-style glob like '*.csv'.

Options:
  --server TEXT                  URL of the Fester IIIF manifest service
                                 [default: https://iiif.library.ucla.edu]
  --endpoint TEXT                API endpoint for CSV uploading  [default:
                                 /collections]
  --out TEXT                     local directory to put the updated CSV
                                 [default: output]
  --iiifhost TEXT                IIIF image server URL (optional)
  --loglevel [INFO|DEBUG|ERROR]  [default: INFO]
  --help                         Show this message and exit.
```

The SRC argument supports standard [filename globbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) rules. In other words, `*.csv` is a valid entry for the SRC argument.

*There are limits* to how many arguments can be sent to a command. This depends on your OS and its configuration. See this [StackExchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/110282/cp-max-source-files-number-arguments-for-copy-utility) post for more information.

Festerize will ignore any files that do not end with `.csv`, so a command of `festerize *.*` should be safe to run. Festerize does not recursively search folders.

Festerize creates a folder (by default called `./output`) for all output. CSVs returned by the Fester service are stored there, with the same name as the SRC file.

Festerize also creates a log file in the output folder, named the current date and time of the run, with an extension of `.log`. By default, the start and end time of the run are added as INFO rows to this log file, but this can be disabled by setting the `--loglevel` option to `--loglevel ERROR`.
